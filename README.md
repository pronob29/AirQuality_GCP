# Machine Learning Model Deployment on Google Cloud Platform

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It encompasses model training, exporting, uploading to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), deploying on Google AI Platform, and setting up a prediction service.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide for deploying machine learning models using GCP services. The steps include:

1. **Model Training and Export**: Training a machine learning model using TensorFlow and exporting it in a format compatible with GCP services.
2. **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Uploading the exported model to GCS for storage and accessibility during deployment.
3. **Google AI Platform**: Deploying the model on Google AI Platform, configuring necessary settings such as model versioning and resource allocation.
4. **Prediction Service**: Creating a prediction service that enables real-time or batch predictions via RESTful APIs.
5. **Testing and Monitoring**: Testing the deployed model to ensure proper functionality and utilizing GCP's monitoring tools to track performance and usage metrics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `model/`: Contains the trained machine learning model files.
- `scripts/`: Includes scripts for training, exporting, and deploying the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of model training and deployment.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for replication.

## Getting Started
